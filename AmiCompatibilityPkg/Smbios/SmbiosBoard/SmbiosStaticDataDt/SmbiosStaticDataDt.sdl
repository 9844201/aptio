##############################################################################
#
#   The information in this structure defines the attributes of a single
#   processor; a separate structure instance is provided for each system
#   processor socket/slot.  For example, a system with an IntelDX2 processor
#   would have a single structure instance while a system with an IntelSX2
#   processor would have a structure to describe the main CPU and a second
#   structure to describe the 80487 co-processor.
#
#   NOTE : One structure is provided for each processor instance in a system.
#   For example, a system that supports up to two processors includes two
#   Processor Information Structures - even if only one processor is
#   currently installed. Software that interprets the SMBIOS information
#   can count the Processor Information structures to determine the maximum
#   possible configuration of the system.
